## ✅ Implementation Summary
Successfully added the "Lokasi Penyerahan Unit" field to the car rental form in ListMobil.js:

### Features Added:
1. **Dropdown Selection**: Users can choose from 3 clean delivery location options:
   - **Rumah** (Home - uses registered client address)
   - **Kantor** (Office - uses company address)
   - **Titik Temu** (Meeting Point - requires additional address input)
2. **Conditional Input**: When "Titik Temu" is selected, an additional address field appears
3. **Database Integration**: Location data is saved to Firestore in the `pemesanan` collection
4. **Form Validation**: The field integrates seamlessly with existing form validation

### Technical Changes:
- Added 2 new state variables: `lokasiPenyerahan` and `titikTemuAddress`
- Extended `handleTanggalChange` function to handle location changes
- Updated `handleSewa` function to include location data in order creation
- Added UI components with consistent styling matching the existing form design

### Testing Results:
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no compilation errors
- ✅ All syntax is correct
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## ✅ Admin Display Implementation Complete

### Additional Features Added to ManajemenPesanan.js:
1. **Location Display**: Added "Lokasi Penyerahan Unit" field in the order details grid
2. **Meeting Point Display**: Shows meeting point address with location pin icon when "Titik Temu" is selected
3. **Enhanced Search**: Updated search functionality to include location and meeting point address
4. **Updated Placeholder**: Modified search placeholder to mention location search capability

### Technical Changes in ManajemenPesanan.js:
- ✅ Added location display in the order information grid
- ✅ Enhanced search functionality to include `lokasiPenyerahan` and `titikTemuAddress` fields
- ✅ Updated search placeholder text to include location search
- ✅ Added conditional display for meeting point address with location pin icon

### Admin Features:
- **View Location**: Admins can see the selected delivery location for each order (Rumah/Kantor/Titik Temu)
- **View Meeting Point**: When "Titik Temu" is selected, the specific address is displayed with location pin
- **Search by Location**: Admins can search orders by delivery location or meeting point address
- **Consistent UI**: Location information integrates seamlessly with existing order management interface

### User Experience Improvements:
- **Cleaner Interface**: Simplified dropdown options (Rumah, Kantor, Titik Temu) instead of long descriptive text
- **Intuitive Logic**: Users understand that "Rumah" means their registered home address, "Kantor" means company address
- **Clear Meeting Point**: "Titik Temu" clearly indicates when a custom address is needed

The implementation is complete and ready for use! Both client-side booking and admin-side management now fully support the "Lokasi Penyerahan Unit" feature.
