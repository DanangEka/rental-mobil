## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test navigation to History Pesanan page
- [ ] Verify all user orders are displayed
- [ ] Test edit functionality for ongoing orders
- [ ] Test cancel functionality for ongoing orders
- [ ] Verify price recalculation when dates are changed
- [ ] Test modal close functionality
- [ ] Verify Firebase updates are reflected properly

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify status colors are correct
- [ ] Test loading states
- [ ] Verify empty state when no orders exist
- [ ] Test modal interactions and form validation

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with different order statuses
- [ ] Verify role-based access (only clients can access)
- [ ] Test with multiple orders
- [ ] Verify real-time updates when orders change

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with orders that have missing data
- [ ] Test date validation (end date after start date)
- [ ] Test with very old orders
- [ ] Test cancel operation on different order statuses

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the application and test all functionality
2. **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues found during testing
3. **Performance**: Optimize queries and rendering if needed
4. **Enhancements**: Consider adding search/filter functionality if needed

## 📝 Notes

- The component uses real-time listeners to automatically update when orders change
- Edit functionality only works on ongoing orders (not completed or cancelled)
- Cancel functionality makes the car available again in the database
- Price is automatically recalculated when dates are changed
- All changes are immediately reflected in the UI through Firestore real-time listeners
